This repository contains all of **my code and resources** for learning and implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch and with popular Python libraries.
I have also **written all the ML algorithmes theories** to study the the theoritical concepts better and more clearly.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project covers the core concepts and practical implementations of machine learning, including:

- Data Preprocessing
- Regression (Simple, Multiple, Polynomial, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Regression Template)
- Classification (Logistic, K-NN, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Classification Template)
- Clustering (K-Means, Hierarchical)
- Association Rule Learning (Apriori, Eclat)
- Reinforcement Learning (Upper Confidence Bound, Thompson Sampling)
- Model Selection & Evaluation (K-Fold Cross Validation & Grid Search, XGBoost)
